                <h2>Real Time Monitoring of Parking Spots using Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    A real-time parking occupancy detection system built with OpenCV and Machine Learning. 
                    The project processes parking lot surveillance video, detects whether each parking spot is 
                    occupied or vacant, and overlays results directly on the live video feed. Extracted individual parking 
                    spots from video frames, build custom dataset of 2K+ cropped images, manually labeled as occupied or vacant.
                    Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for binary classification (occupied vs available). 
                    Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning (kernel, C, gamma) to maximize performance. 
                    Achieved 90%+ prediction accuracy on test samples.

                <h2>Bangalore Home Price Prediction</h2>
                <p>
                     This project predicts property prices in Bangalore using
                    various features like location, total area (in square feet), number of bedrooms,
                    bathrooms, etc. The solution involves data preprocessing, feature engineering,
                    and training machine learning models, with a Flask-based API for serving predictions.
                    The dataset contains information about various properties in Bangalore, including: Location Size (e.g., "2 BHK," "4 Bedroom") Total Square Feet Price (in Lakhs) Number of Bathrooms
                    The raw dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
                    Achieved a score of 84.9% on training data using Linear Regression. Cross-validation results indicate consistent performance across multiple folds.

                <h2>Telecom Customer Churn Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                 Customer churn is a critical business problem in the telecommunications sector. This project aims to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns, and build predictive models to reduce churn.
                    % Senior Citizens - There are only 16% of the customers who are senior citizens. Thus most of our customers in the data are younger people. Partner and dependent status - About 50% of the customers have a partner, while only 30% of the total customers have dependents. I also looked at any differences between the % of customers with/without dependents and partners by gender. There is no difference in their distribution by gender.
                    Additionally, there is no difference in senior citizen status by gender.

                <h2>Artificial Neural Network: Bank Customer Churn Prediction Analysis using Deep Learning</h2>
                <p>
                  The Bank Customer Churn Prediction project aims to identify customers likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive retention strategies. The dataset includes features such as customer demographics,
                    credit score, account balance, and tenure with the bank. An Artificial Neural Network model was implemented using a Sequential neural network with two hidden layers to classify customers as "churning" or "non-churning.
                     The model's architecture leveraged activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output to predict probabilities. The dataset was preprocessed through normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, geography). A train-test split ensured robust model evaluation,
                    and performance was measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score."

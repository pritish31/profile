                <li><strong>Data Scientist, JerseySTEM (July 2024 - Present)</strong>

                     <p><strong>Dashboarding for Market Research: </strong> At JerseySTEM, I led the development of a real-time dashboard using MySQL, Salesforce, and Looker Studio to track $100,000 in
                    funding utilization. This initiative improved financial transparency and supported data-driven decision-making.
                    I collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements, optimized complex SQL queries, and automated reporting processes
                    to deliver actionable insights efficiently.</p>

                     <p><strong>HR Analytics: </strong> In addition to dashboarding, I conducted HR analytics using Python and SQL
                         to identify trends and improve operational efficiency. I built predictive models to enhance retention strategies and
                         deployed a data management app using AppSheet with a Figma-designed interface. This app increased data efficiency by
                         30% and reduced errors by 20%, showcasing my ability to develop data-driven solutions that directly
                         address business needs.</p>

                <li><strong>Prompt Engineer, Outlier.ai | Remote (Oct 2024 - Present):</strong>
                    At Outlier.ai, I enhanced the accuracy and reliability of large language model (LLM) responses across mathematical,
                Python, and SQL tasks by identifying and correcting errors. Using prompt engineering, I resolved model weaknesses and improved
                quality. I also evaluated outputs for instruction comprehension, accuracy, and efficiency, ensuring adherence to high-quality
                standards, thereby contributing to the refinement of AI-driven solutions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Developer and Data Analyst, Freelancer | India (Jul 2021 - May 2022):</strong>
                    As a Freelancer, I developed a real-time dashboard integrating Salesforce and campaign data using Looker Studio and Power BI,
                    empowering clients with actionable insights. Additionally, I designed an AppSheet-based delivery tracking app for a
                    sustainable food brand, improving efficiency by 30% through real-time updates on deliveries and inventory. These projects
                    highlight my ability to create impactful, data-driven tools tailored to business needs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Analyst, Codewrap Software Solutions | India (Oct 2017 - Dec 2019):</strong>
                    At Codewrap Software Solutions, I developed predictive models to identify credit card defaults, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.779
                    with XGBoost, which improved risk assessment for 30,000 accounts. I conducted data preprocessing, resolved inconsistencies,
                    and optimized machine learning models to enhance accuracy and outcomes. By creating actionable insights and dashboards using
                    SHAP values and ROC curves, I enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and reduce credit default risks.
